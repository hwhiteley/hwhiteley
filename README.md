- 👋 Hi, I’m Hannah Whiteley.
- 👀 I’ll be graduating in September 2024 from my Bioinformatics Masters at Birkbeck and UCL.
- 🌱 I’m currently using R for analysis on data from the GWAS catalog. My project is seeking to understand if TDP-43 cryptic splicing events happen near neurodegenerative disease risk genes.
- 💡 My interests include tidying data and visualisation, especially for health data as I have a background in biology, BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science.
- 🖥️ Seeking a full time role from September 2024 in data analysis/business analysis/project management.
